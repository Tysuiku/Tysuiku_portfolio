        <p>
          From the thrilling world of gaming to the intricate realm of software development, I've embraced the challenge and channeled my passion into creating outstanding digital experiences. As a New York-based former semi-professional gamer turned software engineer, my skills encompass web development, video editing, and a variety of other digital media disciplines.</p>
<p class="text-[#44566c] leading-7 mt-2.5 dark:text-color-910">Leveraging my unique gaming background, I am committed to crafting immersive and engaging user experiences that leave a lasting impression. With a keen eye for detail and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I strive to make the digital world more captivating, one project at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          While I had originally aspired to become a professional gamer, a sequence of life circumstances and the absence of adequate support steered me away from that path. Despite this, I did not lose sight of the horizon; instead, I discovered a new passion - programming.

          I embarked on a journey of immersive learning at App Academy and emerged in April 2023, armed with a deep understanding of Ruby on Rails and React-Redux. This transformation not only sharpened my technical proficiency but also fostered a genuine love for coding, which I hadn't foreseen.
          
          My experience has taught me the value of adaptability and the potential that lies in the face of adversity. With an unwavering spirit, I am eager to harness my expertise in Ruby on Rails and React-Redux within a professional landscape, thereby turning the page to a new chapter of growth and innovation.
